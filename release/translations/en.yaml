  frame_width:
    name: Frame Width
    description: |
      Video frame width in pixels for processing
      - Lower values = faster processing but may reduce accuracy
      - Recommended: 320 (balanced performance and accuracy)
      - Range: 160-1920
  frame_height:
    name: Frame Height
    description: |
      Video frame height in pixels for processing
      - Lower values = faster processing but may reduce accuracy
      - Recommended: 240 (balanced performance and accuracy)
      - Range: 120-1080
  target_fps:
    name: Target FPS
    description: |
      Target frames per second for gesture detection
      - Lower values = lower CPU usage
      - Recommended: 10-15 (smooth and resource-efficient)
      - Range: 5-30
  skip_frames:
    name: Skip Frames
    description: |
      Process every Nth frame (for further performance improvement)
      - 1 = process all frames (most accurate, most resource-intensive)
      - 2 = process half frames (balanced)
      - 3+ = skip more frames (best performance, may miss gestures)
      - Recommended: 1-2

      Minimum confidence level to detect hands (0.3-1.0)
      - 0.5 = Google official default (recommended)
      - Higher = stricter, fewer false detections, may miss hands
      - Lower = looser, more sensitive, easier to detect hands
      - Recommended: 0.5 (balanced accuracy and detection rate)
  min_tracking_confidence:
    name: Hand Tracking Confidence
    description: |
      Minimum confidence level to track hands (0.3-1.0)
      - 0.5 = Google official default (recommended)
      - Higher = stricter, more stable tracking, may lose tracking
      - Lower = looser, more flexible tracking, easier to maintain tracking
      - Recommended: 0.5 (balanced stability and flexibility)

      - 0.5 = Recommended (balanced accuracy and detection rate)
      - Higher = stricter, fewer false recognitions, may miss gestures
      - Lower = looser, more sensitive, may recognize incorrectly
      - Google model accuracy 95%+, suggest using 0.5-0.6
  gesture_min_detections:
    name: Minimum Detections
    description: |
      Number of consecutive detections required to trigger a gesture (2-10)
      - Higher = more stable, fewer false positives, slower response
      - Lower = more sensitive, faster response, may trigger false positives
      - Recommended: 2-3 (fast response and stable)
      - Time reference: 2×≈0.06s, 3×≈0.13s, 5×≈0.30s
  gesture_cooldown:
    name: Cooldown Period
    description: |
      Cooldown time in seconds between repeated triggers of the same gesture
      - Prevents the same gesture from triggering multiple times
      - Recommended: 1.0-2.0 seconds
      - Range: 0.5-10.0
